RIP CodeEval

I never broke into the top 40, but I sat in the 40s and 50s on the site for years. The hardest problems became too time-consuming and heuristical in their solutions for me to waste time on, but I loved the site despite its flaws. I wish everyone involved with the site the best of luck. 

This depot contains my solutions for various CodeEval.com challenge problems. I never included the problem descriptions in the solutions, but maybe someone has archived them. Most are obvious, but some aren't. If you've archived them, please let me know. Also feel free to ask me whatever questions you may have about the problems and their solutions, since there's no longer any scoring and thus no cheating.
